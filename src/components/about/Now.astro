        <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
        <p>As of March 2023, here are a few things I'm focused on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Working as a freelance web developer and designer, taking on
            projects for clients across various industries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learning React.js and improving my skills in front-end development
            to stay up to date with the latest web development trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reading books on personal development and productivity, trying to
            find ways to optimize my workflow and improve my work-life balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taking online courses on digital marketing and SEO to expand my
            skillset and offer additional services to my clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spending time outdoors and staying active through hiking and
            cycling, as a way to balance my work with physical activity and
            mental relaxation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I'm Not Doing</h3>
        <p>
          To focus on the things that matter most, here are a few things I'm
          intentionally not doing right now:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Taking on any long-term commitments that would interfere with my
            ability to deliver quality work to my clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spending too much time on social media or other distractions that
            could take away from my productivity and creativity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Neglecting my physical and mental health by skipping workouts or not
            taking time to unwind and relax outside of work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This Now page reflects my current priorities and goals, and I will
          update it regularly as my focus and activities change over time.
