## 1 | Prove Real‑World Success

| Case studies           | LLMs surface brands with measurable impact.     | Publish results (traffic, revenue, engagement) and client quotes. |
| Industry lists & awards| Third‑party rankings act as citations.         | Pitch editors at **IndeedSEO** and similar outlets with evidence. |
| Reviews on platforms   | Reviews feed AI training data.                  | Encourage detailed feedback on **G2**, **Capterra**, **Clutch**. |

## 2 | Create AI‑Friendly On‑Site Content

- Use clear H1 → H3 headings, brief paragraphs, and bullet lists.
- Answer natural questions (“What is Reddit marketing?”) in plain language.
- Maintain an objective tone; avoid hype.
- Add statistics and sourced quotations. GEO studies show 30–40% visibility gains with data-rich pages.
- Improve readability with tools such as Hemingway.
- Skip keyword stuffing; it offers little benefit.

---

## 3 | Publish Deep Thought Leadership

- Long-form guides on Reddit culture, ethical ads, and community building.
- Data-driven case studies.
- “Dos and Don’ts” checklists for brands.
- Provide a brief “Key Takeaways” box so AI can extract concise facts.
- Refresh content regularly; freshness lifts AI rankings.

## 4 | Add Machine‑Readable Signals

| Technical Task       | Action                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structured data       | Implement `Organization`, `LocalBusiness`, and `ProfessionalService` schema. |
| FAQ markup            | Use `FAQPage` schema for question-answer sections.                    |
| `llms.txt` file       | List priority pages and short descriptions in the root directory.     |
| Core web vitals       | Ensure fast load times, mobile friendliness, and no broken links.     |
| Canonicals            | Prevent duplicate content confusion.                                  |

## 5 | Earn High‑Authority Backlinks

- Contribute guest articles to marketing blogs and podcasts.
- Co-author content with influencers or partner agencies.
- Secure neutral **Wikipedia** and **Crunchbase** citations where eligible.

---

## 6 | Fuel Unbiased Third‑Party Mentions

- Offer helpful answers in r/marketing and related subreddits — no overt promotion.
- Issue press releases for milestones; journalists provide AI-crawlable coverage.
- Join webinars or podcasts; transcripts add new citation sources.

---

## 7 | Track Visibility and Iterate

- Use tools like **Profound** or **Surfer AI Tracker** to check visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Copilot.
- Analyze competitor pages that win citations.
- Update content with stronger stats, quotes, or new formats (videos, infographics).

---

## 8 | Apply Domain‑Specific GEO Insights

- For B2B marketing topics, adding fresh statistics and citations improves visibility by roughly 30–40%.
- Include expert or client quotations to strengthen authority signals.
- Prioritize clarity and data over persuasive tone.

---

## 9 | Stay Ethical

- Do not claim “#1” status without independent validation.
- Follow subreddit rules to avoid bans. Genuine value drives organic mentions.

---

## 10 | Treat GEO as Its Own Discipline

AI search is not traditional SEO. LLMs mediate what users see, and forward-thinking marketers are adapting now. Start early, measure progress, and refine continuously.
