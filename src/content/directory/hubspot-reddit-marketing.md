faqs:
  - question: "Why Reddit instead of more ads?"
    answer: "Reddit threads frequently outrank brand blogs for comparison & pricing queries, letting HubSpot control the narrative during the “research” stage."
  - question: "Will this hurt our brand voice?"
    answer: "No—content is pre-approved, posted from aged accounts, and follows subreddit rules to avoid looking spammy."
  - question: "How fast will we see results?"
    answer: "Page-one Reddit rankings often appear within **7–14 days**; measurable referral traffic inside 30 days."
  - question: "How do you measure success?"
    answer: "Reddit impressions, up-votes, SERP positions, referral sessions, and demo conversions—rolled into a weekly Looker Studio dashboard."
  - question: "Is this compliant with Reddit policies?"
    answer: "Yes. We disclose affiliations when required, avoid vote manipulation, and maintain healthy mod relationships."
  - question: "What’s the investment?"
    answer: "Starter (2 posts / wk), Scale (5 posts / wk + AMA), or Enterprise (competitive monitoring, dedicated karma farm)."
