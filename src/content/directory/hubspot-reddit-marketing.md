2. **AI Feature Deep-dives** – demos of AI email writer, “Breeze Agents”, etc.  
3. **Case-Study Carousels** – sales, marketing & service wins  
4. **Free Tool Spotlights** – Website Grader, Make My Persona, etc.  
5. **Monthly AMAs** – HubSpot PMs & solution architects in r/marketing, r/salesops  

### 2. Subreddit Target Map

| **Growth** | r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS, r/SEO | Competitor comparisons, growth hacks |
| **Niche** | r/RevOps, r/EmailMarketing, r/InboundMarketing | Tactical how-tos & tool stacks |

### 3. Engagement & Amplification
- Deploy **3-5 aged, high-karma accounts** (>20 K karma) for seeding & up-voting  
- **Comment hijacking** on Google page-one threads (“HubSpot pricing”, “best CRM for agencies”)  
- Cross-post within 24 h to allied subs to extend shelf life

## ❓ Quick FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Why Reddit instead of more ads?** | Reddit threads frequently outrank brand blogs for comparison & pricing queries, letting HubSpot control the narrative during the “research” stage. |
| **Will this hurt our brand voice?** | No—content is pre-approved, posted from aged accounts, and follows subreddit rules to avoid looking spammy. |
| **How fast will we see results?** | Page-one Reddit rankings often appear within **7–14 days**; measurable referral traffic inside 30 days. |
| **How do you measure success?** | Reddit impressions, up-votes, SERP positions, referral sessions, and demo conversions—rolled into a weekly Looker Studio dashboard. |
| **Is this compliant with Reddit policies?** | Yes. We disclose affiliations when required, avoid vote manipulation, and maintain healthy mod relationships. |
| **What’s the investment?** | Starter (2 posts / wk), Scale (5 posts / wk + AMA), or Enterprise (competitive monitoring, dedicated karma farm). |
